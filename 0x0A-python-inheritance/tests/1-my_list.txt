"""
MyList
======

A class that inherits from the built-in 'list' class.

This class provides a convenient way to print lists in sorted, ascending order.

Examples
--------

Creating an instance of MyList:

>>> my_list = MyList([3, 2, 1])

Printing the list in sorted order:

>>> my_list.print_sorted()
[1, 2, 3]

The original list is not modified by the print_sorted() method:

>>> print(my_list)
[3, 2, 1]

Note that MyList can also be instantiated with no arguments, creating an empty list:

>>> empty_list = MyList()
>>> print(empty_list)
[]

Methods
-------

print_sorted()
    Prints the list in sorted, ascending order.
